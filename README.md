### Problem

Companies often face a problem of **over spending** on new hires, whereby they spend more money than they have to hire new people. Over spending would negatively impact the financial health of the company and result in decreased profit, debts, and even bankcruptcy if uncontrolled. 

Imagine that a company spends **500,000 dollars** on new hires annually when it has **200,000 dollars**. The company incurs a deficit of **300,000 dollars**. The company can avoid over spending by knowing how much new hires are going to cost, and compare the cost with what they have, to determine who and how many people they can hire.
