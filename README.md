The project predicts whether an employee will stay or leave the company. 

### Problem

High employee turnover can have a severe impact on businesses in terms of productivity, time, and money. When an employee leaves, productivity decreases and companies have to find a replacement, which costs time and money due to advertising, interviewing, training, and hiring a new employee. When an employee leaves, it takes more resources for a company to return to the same level of productivity it had before.

### Solution

Analytics can be applied to understand why employees leave and predict whether an employee will leave the company. Understanding why employees leave will help organizations come up with specific strategies to retain employees, and predicting whether an employee will leave allows the company to either focus on these employees and try to retain them, or invest less efforts on these employees since they will be leaving. Therefore the analyses has two goals to solve the problem of a high turnover rate:

  1. Understand why employees leave
  2. Predict which employees will leave
